# Python Challenge
This task contains two Python scripts, each for analyzing a different dataset. PyBank and PyPoll.

# PyBank Instructions
In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote

In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
